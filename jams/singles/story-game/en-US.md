## Choose Wisely, Code Boldly; Crafting a Build Your Own Adventure Game!

Whether you have programmed your whole life or this is your very first project, there is plenty of fun to be had with creating a Choose 
Your Own Adventure Game (CYOA)! This build incorporates music, interactive elements, and the ability to control all stylistic features! 
The most important part is to use your imagination since there is no limit to what YOU can create! No matter what difficulty you choose, 
you will have a playable game fit to share with family, and friends, and publish! You will gain invaluable knowledge in Python which you 
can use to create more games or implement in other projects!

## What Will We Use?

- We will be using an online coding platform called ***Replit***. It provides a browser based integrated development environment (IDE),
  which allows users to write, run, and collaborate on programs with support multiple programming languages! The best part? It is
  available on *ALL* devices!

Here is Replit's Documentation for future Reference: https://docs.replit.com/

- We will also be using ***Python*** to complete this project! Any familiarity with the language is recommended but *not* required!


## Why Choose Python?

#### Click Here to Start Building: https://replit.com/

1. Simplicity and Readability: Python's syntax is best known for its readability and simplicity making it a great option for beginners and
   those who would like a more straightforward language. 
3. Beginner Friendly: Python's syntax resembles natural language. This allows users to focus on programming concepts more than complex
   syntax. 
4. Rapid Development and Prototyping: Python's focus on code simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries allow users to quickly
   prototype and iterate on ideas.

Here is the example code of what we're going to create!: https://replit.com/@ConnemaraPony/Beginner-CYOA?v=1

Building a Choose Your Own Adventure Game is kinda like making a **pizza**! First, the base! The most important part, and the thing that 
holds everything up... *drum roll please...* the storyline!

![The storyline, the base of all games, is like the dough of a pizza. ](https://cloud-kck0n0txs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0copy_of_copy_of_arial.gif)

## What Makes Text Based Adventure Games SO Playable?

CYOA's are interactive experiences that transport players into imaginative worlds through text based narratives. They normally have rich 
storylines which make players embark on thrilling quests, solve puzzles, and make choices that shape the course of the game!

Embracing the power of imagination, these games are extremely immersive and invite players to visualize the game world and become active 
participants in the unfolding story. 

Moral of the story is that text adventure games have a huge emphasis on storyline and user interaction. The adventures had are timeless 
and engaging gaming experiences for players of all ages. 

So what's the most important part? Planning.


## Game Design

![You need to branch out with Gane Design](https://cloud-d4qej17bj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0story2.gif)

### Choosing a Theme or Setting! 


Start brainstorming different themes or settings for your story! It could be a mysterious haunted mansion, fantastical forest, or anything 
that sparks your imagination! Here are some ideas to get started:

- You discover a secret cave with mysterious tunnels each housing... peculiar creatures
- You and a group of friends decide to go to a haunted mansion, but things aren't at all what they seem
- You're being chased and have to escape a maze
- You're opening your own pizza shop
- You're stranded on a desert island
- You're the mayor of a small and... quiet... town
- Create a short "what  ___ am I?" quiz
- Create a realistic roleplay 
- Each person is gifted a special power... what's yours?

The best part is the sky's the limit! Keep brainstorming until you find something you want to start with.

Also consider the potential story choices, depth, and player engagement.

### Planning Game Structure!
![Planning a player's journey](https://cloud-ojeynixq6-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled_design-removebg-preview.png)

Define what the game structure by figuring out the overall goal that players will strive to achieve. It can be finding treasure, surviving 
on an abandoned island, solving a mystery, or saving the world!

In this stage determine the key challenges, events, or puzzles the players will face through their journey. You can also take this time to 
divide your game into different chapters/levels if you would like. 

Now figure out your player's choices. Imagine a tree, and each choice is a different branch of the story. Identify these "branching off" 
points in the narrative where the player's choices will affect the outcome. 

### Characters!
![Characters](https://cloud-8yiaur9jb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0untitled_design__2_.gif)

This is also a good time to figure out any potential non-player characters (NPC's). These are characters that the player can interact with 
and can make the storyline richer.  

Here are some tips that can help your character become more fleshed out, relatable, and believable, hooking the user to your game:

- Make your characters have "strong" and or detailed backstories that can include their past experiences, goals, motivations, etc.
- Give your characters unique personalities! Think about their temperament, speech patterns, and quirks. How do they express themselves
  and relate to others? 
	- When writing their dialogue pay attention to how they speak and their language; make sure it reflects their personality and
          background.
- These NPCs can even have a character arc throughout the story, or perhaps the user's character can influence them. 
	- You could even create side quests that allow the user to strengthen their relationship with them allowing the, to unlock other
          levels. 
		- This can allow your player to have a more immersive experience.
- You can also make your characters complex by considering their relationships with other NPC characters in the game or the user's. 

Once you're all done writing everything up- let's start programming!

### Main Game loop

To start we have to have something that will loop for the game checking if the player wants to quit or start over.  To do this we will be 
using a `while` loop. 

Now what is that? Why is it important?

Well we want something to loop/run through the code for an *unlimited* amount of time that checks whether or not our game will end. 

That is *exactly* what a `while` loop is! It is a repetitive loop that runs until a certain condition becomes *false*! 

Let's start by creating our game's status. We would like the game to keep running until the game's status goes from "yes" to "no". Here's 
an example: `gameStart == "yes"`. 

Then we need to set our loop to continuously check that our game's status is equal to "yes". For this, we will write `while` followed by 
our condition (`gameStart == yes`) and a colon. 

Then we have to make sure that our player can add their input to determine whether they want to play or not. Inside the while loop, we 
will add our variable again: `gameStart` but we'll set it `=` to `input("")` and inside the `""` we can add the question of whether or not 
they would like to quit.

*Note: keep in mind that if they would like to restart or continue with the game it has to equal what our variable was, in this case, 
"yes" if they input anything else the game will quit.*

Yay! We've successfully created a `while` loop that checks whether or not our game has ended based on the player's input.

This is what an example of the should look like:

```py
gameStart = "yes"

while gameStart == "yes":
    gameStart = input("Would you like to restart? ")

```


## Let's Make Our Game Design Come to Life!

### Input System 

Let's say for this game we are crafting a pizza and have different choices for special edition toppings: Potatoes or Champignon Mushrooms 
using the `print` function.

```py
gameStart = "yes"

while gameStart == "yes":

    # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the 
      final game
    # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!
    # add all game-related content inside this loop

    print("Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!")
    print("What would you like for your toppings? Potatoes or 
    Champignon Mushrooms")

    gameStart = input("Would you like to restart? ")

```

Like earlier we would like our player to be able to *choose* what they would like to do. To do that let's create a variable to store our 
user's input for this particular question and name it `pizza_choice`.  Like earlier, we're going to set `pizza_choice` = to `input("")`. 

`input(" *insert text/question here* ")` prompts our player to respond, allows the program to wait for user input, and stores that in the 
variable it is = to for further processing later on (ex. what happens when they choose different options). 

it will look something like this: `pizza_choice = input("Please choose one > ")`

### Choices (Conditionals)

But how will we use the input?

Simple! Conditionals! These are composed of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements which enable your program to perform different actions or 
execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false! 

*unlike `while` loops* they do *not* run forever. 

Using our example from before: `if pizza_choice`  is `==` to `"Potatoes"` then `:` let's `print("")` "You chose" `+ pizza_choice +` "!  
That's delicious! Coming right up!"

But our other if/else if or in python, `elif pizza_choice` is `==` to `"Champignon Mushrooms"` then `:` let's `print("")` "You chose" `+ 
pizza_choice +` "! It is a fan favorite!"

But what if our user inputs something different? If we don't plan for that, then our program will have an `error` and the game will stop. 
So, if our player writes anything `else` or other than our option, then `:` we'll `print("")` out "Sorry we do not have that item. Come 
back another time."

The final code would look something like this: 
```py
gameStart = "yes"

while gameStart == "yes":

    # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the final game
    # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!
    # add all game related content inside this loop

    print("Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!")
    print("What would you like for your toppings? Potatoes or 
    Champignon Mushrooms")

    pizza_choice = input("Please choose one > ")

    if pizza_choice == "Potatoes":
        print("You chose" + pizza_choice + "! That's delicious!
        Coming right up!")

    elif pizza_choice == "Champignon Mushrooms":
	        print("You chose" + pizza_choice + "! It is a fan   
	        favorite!")

    else:
        print("Sorry we do not have that item. Come back another 
        time.")

    gameStart = input("Would you like to restart? ")

```

### Point Systems

If you are also interested in making a point system for your game start by making a variable, let's call it `points` and set it ` = 0` (or 
whatever number of points you want your character to start with).

Next, we need to define (`def`) our function that adds the points the player gets throughout the game let's call it 
`add_points(number_of_points)`. Then `:` we're going to make our `points` variable `global` meaning that it can be easily accessed and 
changed anywhere throughout the code. 

Under that, we need to say that our `points` will get combined `+=` with the `number_of_points` the player earns. 

To tell our player how many points they got let's create another `def` for our function `print_points()` then `:` say `print("You have {} 
points.")` and let's insert the number of points our player got by adding `.format(points)` which will change our placeholder `{}` with 
the number of points our player has.

Here is what we should get:
```py
points = 0

def add_points(number_of_points):
  global points
  points += number_of_points

def print_points():
  print("You have {} adventure points.".format(points))
```

To add points we should call the `add_points()` function and determine in the `()` how many points to add.

To `print` how many points the player has just use the `print_points()` function. 

```py
add_points(30)
print_points()
```

With this base, you can now use a combination of while loops, conditionals, print, and input functions to build fabulous tales!


## Congratulations!

You have successfully finished ***Level 1: The Storyteller's Forge***! You now have your own Adventure Game which you can publish, share 
with family and friends, and play! 

#### Want to take your build to the next level? 

Let's add some music and customization options (like colors and text animation!)
Go to the next level now! 


##  Level 2: Sonic Sagas
### Adding Music and Style to your Text-Based Adventure Game

![Adding music and style](https://cloud-3usasijgs-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0copy_of_arial.gif)

Once again, great job in finishing ***Level 1: The Storyteller's Forge***. Now we're moving on to the second layer of the **pizza**, the 
*sauce*! A cool add-on that gives a kick of flavor! In this level, we will be learning how to add background music, sound effects, text 
animation, and color! 

<video src="https://cloud-mxm9fsiqn-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0level_2_cyoa.mp4" controls="controls" style={{maxWidth: "720px"}}></video>

Here is the example code of what we're going to create!: https://replit.com/@ConnemaraPony/Intermediate-CYOA?v=1


## Making Music

Before we learn how to incorporate music it is important to know where to *find* it. Nowadays, we have access to a variety of free music 
libraries. Here are some examples:
- YouTube Audio Library (Free)
- Slip.Stream (Pro and Free)
- Free Music Archive (Pro and Free)
- SoundStripe (Pro and Free)
- iMovie (Free)

Always remember that when publishing your work make sure the music or even graphics you use are *not* copyrighted because that can give 
you a headache in the legal department. Instead, try to find *royalty free* music or have a license to use it commercially. 

You can even make your own music! Here are some example options:
- Create a music generator!
- Use existing music software on your device (ex. GarageBand)
- Make music on MuseScore

Once you figure out your music and sound effects... it's time to start!

### Adding backGround() Music

Adding music to your replit game is very simple! 
Let's start off by `import`ing the module `audio from` a package called `replit`. And add it at the very top of our game (I'll be using 
the pizza example from earlier):
```py
from replit import audio

# Rest of the game code goes below
GameStart = "yes"

while GameStart == "yes":
	...
```

Now you have to make sure to import your music files to the project. You can either drag and drop your files into the sidebar or press 
"new file."

Once everything is downloaded let's define the music we're adding to our game. The function I'm going to `def` is the `backGround()` 
function and then `:` I'm going to show where the program can locate my music file or `source`. I'll set `source =` to my 
`audio.play_file('')` so that it knows to process and play my music, and inside the `''` I'll add my file name. In this case 
`'Mezzogiorno.mp3'`. 

*Note: Replit audio currently supports .wav, .mp3, and .aif files. If your file has a different extension then it will not work. *

Now I need to make sure my music *plays* when the game is running. To do that I'll just call the function in the main loop like so: 
`backGround()`

There you have it! Here is what the code should look like:
```py
"""
This is a block comment which is great for comments that are longer than one line.

Music creators! 
Background Music: Track: "Mezzogiorno"
Music provided by https://slip.stream
Free Download / Stream: https://get.slip.stream/p2t2Ot

"""
from replit import audio

def backGround():
    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')
  
gameStart = "yes"
while gameStart == "yes":
  # this is a comment, something that will not appear in the final 
    game
  # It is great for taking notes and explaining code!
  # add all game related content inside this loop   
  
  backGround()
  
  ...
```

### Adding soundEffects() 

You use the *exact* same process for sound effects. But how can we determine the *duration* of it? To do that we will need to `import 
time` package. Then, we'll go to our `def` function, and under the `source = ...` we'll add `time.sleep()`. This tells the computer how 
long the music should play until it quits/sleeps. Inside the `()` add the duration. I'll make it set to `(2)`. Then, call on the function 
wherever you would like.

Here is our updated code with my `pop()` sound effect function:
```py
from replit import audio
import time

def backGround():
    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')

def pop():
    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')
    time.sleep(2)
  
gameStart = "yes"
while gameStart == "yes":
  # add all game related content inside this loop   
  
  backGround()

  pop()
  print("Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!")

...
  
```

## Text Animation

One of the most popular text animations for CYOA games is the typewriter effect. So, let's make it! To start off let's `def` a function 
called `typewriter()` and inside the parentheses let's determine what this function will affect which is `(text)`. Then `:` we want to say 
that `for` each letter `in` our `text` the program should then `:` `print()` our `letter`s side by side which can be written as `end=""`, 
and it should be immediately printed or `flush`ed out  which means we have to `=True`. Similar to how we determined music length we need 
to determine how long each letter should wait until it's printed out, to do that we'll use `time.sleep()` and in the parentheses, I'll set 
it to `(0.05)`.

We should have something like this:
```py
def typewriter(text):
  for letter in text:
    print(letter, end="", flush=True)
    time.sleep(0.05)
```

Now to call on it we can change any of the `print("")` functions we have to `typewriter("")`. Here is what our updated code should look 
like:

```py
from replit import audio
import time

def typewriter(text):
    for letter in text:
       print(letter, end="", flush=True)
       time.sleep(0.05)
    
def backGround():
    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')

def pop():
    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')
    time.sleep(2)
  
gameStart = "yes"
while gameStart == "yes":
  # add all game related content inside this loop   
  
  backGround()

  pop()
  typewriter("Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!")

...
```

## Coloring Text

Another cool thing we can do is change our text's color! 

For this, we need to head over to the tools sidebar and go to shell. In the shell let's type `pip install termcolor`. This is a package 
that will help us change the color of our text. It might take a couple of seconds to load. 

After, let's head back to our `main.py` file and `import termcolor`. Let's `def` a new function and name it `change_color()` in the 
parentheses we want to make sure it takes in two inputs: `(text, color)`. The purpose of this function is to take the `text` and change it 
to a given `color`. To make this possible we then `:` write `termcolor.cprint(text,color)`. 

We should have something like this:
```py
import termcolor

def change_color(text, color):
    termcolor.cprint(text, color)
  
```

Now to call on it we can change any of the `print("")` functions we have to `change_color(("add whatever text we like here"), ("add 
whatever color we like here"))`. Here is what our updated code should look like:
```py
from replit import audio
import time

def typewriter(text):
    for letter in text:
        print(letter, end="", flush=True)
        time.sleep(0.05)
    
def backGround():
    source = audio.play_file('Mezzogiorno.mp3')

def pop():
    source = audio.play_file('Pop.mp3')
    time.sleep(2)
  
gameStart = "yes"
while gameStart == "yes":
  # add all game related content inside this loop   
  
  backGround()

  pop()
  typewriter("Welcome to La Mia Pizzeria Preferita!", "red")
```

## Congratulations!

You have successfully finished ***Level 2: Sonic Sagas***! You now have your own Adventure Game with music and style which you can 
publish, share with family and friends, and play! 

#### Want to take your build to the next level? 

Let's add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that will allow our player to interact with the game in a different way~ BUTTONS! 
Go to the next level now! 


## Level 3: GUI,  the Final Boss

### Creating a Graphical User Interface 

![Putting everything together](https://cloud-8dmeqbifb-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0arial.gif)

Once again, great job in finishing **_Level 2: Sonic Sagas_**. Now we're moving on to the third and **final** layer of the **pizza**, 
the *cheese*! It's the thing that all of our users will get to see and experience first before the storyline, music, etc. ***THE GUI!*** 

<video src="https://cloud-o4r2cm0xj-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0point_systems_were_created_at_the_end_of_the_level_1_jam_.mp4" controls="controls" style={{maxWidth: "720px"}}></video>

Here is the example code of what we're going to create!: https://replit.com/@ConnemaraPony/Advanced-CYOA?v=1

## Importing Libraries

To begin we need to import these packages in our Repl:
```py
import tkinter as tk
import time
from replit import audio
```
- `tkinter` is for creating the graphical user interface (GUI)
- `time` is for delays in the typewriter effect and or specifying music duration
- `audio` is for being able to read and play music 

## Point System

Like how we implemented in Level 1 :
```py
points = 0

def add_points(number_of_points):
    global points
    points += number_of_points

def print_points():
    points_label.config(text="You have {} adventure points.".format(points))

# Place where you want players to get points + see num of points
add_points(30)
print_points()
```

## Text Animation

Similar to what we implemented in Level 2 but with a few minor changes: 
```py

def typewriter(text, text_widget):
    for letter in text:
        text_widget.config(state=tk.NORMAL)
        if letter == "\n":
            text_widget.insert(tk.END, "\n")
        else:
            text_widget.insert(tk.END, letter)
            text_widget.see(tk.END)
        text_widget.config(state=tk.DISABLED)
        text_widget.update()
        time.sleep(0.05)

```

- The function takes in two inputs instead of one `(text, text_widget)`
- It still loops over each `letter in text` string
- It makes our `text_widget` editable by setting its state to `tk.NORMAL` -- but what is that? 
	- `text_widget`s are GUI elements that allow for text to appear on windows/frames instead of the terminal/console! (like what
           you're seeing here!)
-  If the letter is on a new line `("\n")` it adds a new line letter into the `text_widget` using the `insert` method. If a character is
   *not* on a new line it inserts the letter in the widget using `insert`. Lastly, it positions the scrollbar to the end of the widget
   using ` see(tk.END)` to make each letter visible.
- After each character is added, the widget is set to `tk.DISABLED` to make it read-only (not editable by the user)
- The widget is updated to show the changes made with `update` method
- We still have the `time.sleep` function for a 0.05-second delay

## Defining Game Functions

This is by far one of ***the most*** important parts. If we don't define our functions properly, or if the computer can not reference them 
during the game then we'll be dealing with **A LOT** of errors. 

Here are some example functions we've already created:

`add_points(number_of_points)` which keeps track of the player's points throughout the game. 

`print_points()` which prints out the number of points the player has.

`typewriter(text, text_widget)` for simulating the typewriter effect. 

Here are some new ones: 

let's `def` a function called `start_game` which is called when our Start button is pressed. It then `:` hides or `pack_forget` the 
`welcome_frame` and shows our new frame (in this case where the user inputs their name) `name_frame.pack()`. 

```py
def start_game():
    welcome_frame.pack_forget()
    name_frame.pack()
```

Next let's `def` our `submit_name` that we talked about earlier (while this is for a user's name, you can rename the function for another 
question where the user input is unique)
```py
def submit_name():
    global points

	# retrieving user input to store in widget name_entry
    name = name_entry.get()
    
    # giving points
    add_points(10)
    print_points()
    
    # what the user sees
    typewriter(f"Hey {name}, now it's time to choose a morning 
    activity!", output_text)
    
    # move on to the next frame and get current 
    name_frame.pack_forget()
    activity_frame.pack()
    
```

Also, make sure to add each part of your story under a `def` function. For example, from above if our player had to choose a morning 
activity we will `def` a function called `select_activity()`  where the player picks an `(activity)` button. Then `:` we can add our 
conditional statements and make sure to add `.pack_forget()` that closes a frame and `.pack` that opens a new frame where needed. 

```py
def select_activity(activity):
	
    if activity == "swimming":
        typewriter("You have chosen swimming!", output_text)
        
        add_points(10)
        print_points()
        
        typewriter("\nYou go to the beach but boating is the only 
        thing available. You get a boat. Things are
        going smoothly until your motor gives out.", 
        output_text)
        
        typewriter("\nYou have two options: SOS (try to flag down a 
        boat for help) or fix (fix the motor 
        yourself).\n", output_text)
        
        activity_frame.pack_forget()
        helpSwim_frame.pack()
        
    elif activity == "hiking":
        add_points(5)
        print_points()
        
        typewriter("\nThere are no trail leaders available at this 
        time. Try again later!", output_text)
        
    elif activity == "volunteer":
        add_points(5)
        print_points()
        
        typewriter("\nUnfortunately, they are still setting up 
        different volunteer opportunities. You decide to 
        rest in the shade and read a book.", output_text)
        
    else:
        
        typewriter("\nUnfortunately, this activity is closed for 
        the day for repairs.", output_text)
        
        add_points(5)
        print_points()
        
        typewriter("Choose a different activity", output_text)
```

Then for the choices that branch out from the original should be `def`ined in a new function. By doing that, and adding a 
`helpSwim_frame.pack()` above, now I can extend my `swimming` adventure:
```py
def submit_helpSwim():
    global points
    helpSwim = helpSwim_entry.get()
    
    if helpSwim == "SOS":
        add_points(30)
        print_points()
        typewriter("You start waving your hands 
                   and yelling at the 
                   top of your lungs.", 
                   output_text)
        typewriter("\nEach second that passes, 
                   the boat is pulled 
                   further away from shore. No 
                   one is able to hear 
                   you.", output_text)
        typewriter("\nYou have to think of 
                   another solution.", 
                   output_text)
        typewriter("\nYour other option is to 
                   fix your motor...", 
                   output_text)
        typewriter("\nYou hop in the water to 
                   check. It is 
                   completely fried and there is

                   tightly wrapped around it.", 
                   output_text)
        typewriter("\nThere is no chance for you 
                   to fix it without 
                   proper tools.", output_text)
        typewriter("\nYou end up deciding to

        print_points()

        typewriter("\nYou end up deciding to

                  output_text)

This `submit_helpSwim()` function is called when the submit button (`helpSwim_button`) is clicked during the swimming activity. It gets 
the user's choice from the `helpSwim_entry` field and gives a different scenario based on the choice (what happens in the conditional 
statements).

Keep storing each part of your in `def` functions... after you're done, let's get to the fun part!

## Creating Main Window and Frames!

We've been talking a lot about windows and frames-- but what are they and what's the difference? Lastly, *how* do we *MAKE* them?

![Comparing windows and frames](https://cloud-p55izwnla-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0digital.png)

This might sound crazy but imagine a house. The window is like an entire house. It has its own structure, windows and doors (title bar, 
and controls), walls (size of window), etc. and it is the main thing that the user interacts with. 

Let's start by creating the `window` object and setting it `=` to the `Tk()` constructor from the `tk` module. This will create the main 
window of the application. 
```py
window = tk.Tk()
```
Next, let's make the `title` bar by writing `window.title("")` and in the `""` writing our title. 

While we're at it, let's set the size of the window by writing `window.geometry("")`, and in the `""` we can specify the size. For now, 
let's make it `("600x400")` pixels.  

This is more of a style choice, but I do not want the window to keep resizing depending on the amount of content inside it. To do this 
let's write `window.resizable()`. Inside the parentheses, it has two arguments width and height. Let's make sure that they *do not* get 
resized by making them both `False`.

By the end we should have something like this:
```py
window.title("Camp Wildwood Adventure")
window.geometry("600x400")
window.resizable(False, False)
```

Next are frames! Building off of our house concept, frames are like the rooms inside of a house. They have their own walls, supports, 
etc., and are areas where you can arrange your "furniture" items and other decor like text, input, buttons, etc. 

Each new event that happens in our game will have a `Frame`. 
To create a frame, first, make a variable for example `welcome_frame`, and set it `=` to `tk.Frame(window)`. 

Continue this for each scene change you have in the game. Here is what we have in our example:
```py
welcome_frame = tk.Frame(window)
name_frame = tk.Frame(window)
activity_frame = tk.Frame(window)
helpSwim_frame = tk.Frame(window)
```

## More GUI Components

Let's Create our Buttons and input using our  `def` function `helpSwim` from earlier as an example. 

All the GUI components we're going to create for each scenario will be connected to their respective frames. For `helpSwim` we have the 
`helpSwim_frame` from the previous step. 

### Crafting Labels!

First step is to create a `label` that `=` its respective `frame`, displaying specified `text` like the question we want to ask the user 
to answer. Then we want to make sure our `label` is organized and displayed within our frame using the `.pack` method:

```py
helpSwim_label = tk.Label(helpSwim_frame,  
                        text="SOS (try to flag
                        down a boat for help) or 
                        fix (fix the motor 
                        yourself)?" 
    
helpSwim_label.pack() 
```

### User Text-Input!

Second step let's make this answer have a text input, to do that let's create a text `Entry()` widget, connect it to our `frame`, and make 
sure it displays by using the `.pack` method:

```py
helpSwim_entry = tk.Entry(helpSwim_frame) helpSwim_entry.pack() 
```

### Buttons!

Next, let's create a submit button (this button format will also work if you're asking your user to choose a button rather than add text 
input like above). 

First, let's create a button widget using the `Button()` class from the `tk` library. The button widget is used to show different 
scenarios when clicked by the user. We also need to connect it to its set `frame`, and make sure we have `text` displayed on the button, 
that `= "Submit"` in this case. 

We also need our button to be called when it is clicked. To do that we need to use the `command` parameter and set it `=` to our `def` 
function, in this case `submit_helpSwim` which we defined earlier. 

Let's also make things fun and change the button color! To do this we use `bg` and set it `=` to a color name. Let's just use `"purple"` 
for now. 

Like before, our *last step* is using `.pack()` to make sure it is displayed correctly~ we should have something like this:

```py
helpSwim_button = tk.Button(helpSwim_frame, text="Submit", command=submit_helpSwim, bg="purple") 

helpSwim_button.pack()
```

### Text Widgets!

Let's also make sure that our storyline has a place to get displayed by creating a `Text` widget that can display multi-line text that is 
set to read-only (so that our users can not alter it). 

Let's create a variable called `output_text` which creates our text widget. Let's use the `Text()` parameter from the `tk` library. We 
need to make sure it is placed in our `window` so that it always appears, and set our `height =` to what we want, and our `width =` to 
what we want. 

We also want to make sure our text is pleasing to look at, and if a word exceeds the width it should go to a new line. To do that we'll 
use the `wrap` parameter that does just that and set it `=` to `tk.WORD` so that it doesn't break apart words and ensures that whole words 
are shown on a single line. 

It should look something like this:

```py
output_text = tk.Text(window, height=10,  
			         width=50, wrap=tk.WORD) 
```

As said before we want to make sure our text is on *read-only*. To do that we will configure or `config()` the state of the `output_text` 
widget and set it `=` to `tk.DISABLED` which doesn't allow the user to edit it. 

Lastly we *need* to `.pack` it to make sure it displays properly:

```py
output_text.config(state=tk.DISABLED) 
output_text.pack()
```

Repeat the first three for all scenarios in your game! Feel free to play around with different questions having user input be either 
buttons or text and even multiple text widgets!

## Displaying Frames and Starting Loop

Finally, it's time for our open house! We can now display the welcome frame and start the GUI event loop using `mainloop()`:
```py 
welcome_frame.pack()
window.mainloop()
```
